Welcome to the [Speech Research @ UoA Github Organisation](https://speechresearch.auckland.ac.nz/)
You are here probably because you are speech or language (or both) enthusiast like everyone else here. So welcome to the club :)
In this repository we share resources we have developed as part of speech and language research we have been part of over this. The intention is to facilitate the use of these resources for the new researchers who join our group.

A few organisation ettiquettes:
1. **PAUSE:** Before using any resources pause and think about where the data is from. Will my research benefit the community that gave me the data in any way. If yes - great! If no - can i do something about it? If not sure - ask around!
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE:** All the resources are a result of many hours of work by the individuals/groups who have made them available for you. So, when you use any resources from here, make sure you acknowledge the makers. If you are not sure how to acknowledge, ask around!
3. **SUPPORT:** We are community with the goal to support each other. By being part of our community it would great if you can support others as well.
4. **GIVE BACK:** Just like you benefit from this repository, when you graduate/ leave this group, try to contribute back to this group.


We love to see people learn and grow, and we are happy to support you in your journey. We are all on the same waka!
